          to work is client-centric and detail-oriented, with a strong emphasis
          on effective communication and problem-solving. I thrive in stressful
          situations and excel at resolving complex issues efficiently, ensuring
          project success and client satisfaction.With the knowledge of frontend
          technologies I have developed several web projects using HTML, CSS,
