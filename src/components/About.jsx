          I am an experienced IT professional with a solid background in both
          SAP modules and front-end development technologies.With 2 years and 10
          months of experience at Accenture, I have had the opportunity to work
          extensively with SAP modules, including MM, PP, PM, QM, and SRM. My
          time at Accenture allowed me to develop a robust understanding of
          enterprise resource planning and business process optimization. I am
          highly motivated and always open to learning new skills. My approach
          to work is client-centric and detail-oriented, with a strong emphasis
          on effective communication and problem-solving. I thrive in stressful
          situations and excel at resolving complex issues efficiently, ensuring
          project success and client satisfaction.With the knowledge of frontend
          technologies I have developed several web projects using HTML, CSS,
          JavaScript, and React, demonstrating my versatility and commitment to
          continuous learning.
